# streambank-model
## Streambank erosion model in Matlab

Paper currently under review.

### Run the model with supplied data

Clone the repo (in terminal)
 
````dos
cd my/fav/directory
git clone https://github.com/mitchellmcm27/streambank-model.git
````

Start up Matlab, navigate to the newly created ```streambank-model``` folder in your Matlab file tree
load "model_data.mat" into matlab, which contains the input data table:

````matlab
load('model_data')
````
 
Run the model on a single site:
````matlab
train_model_monthly(model_data(44,:), 'animate')
````
* 44 is a particular row (site), used for an example
* ```animate``` (optional) tells the function to plot animations of simulations
* ```plt``` (optional) plot major results but no animations
* Animations are saved as .gifs in the ```gifs``` folder
  
Run the model on all sites:
````matlab
output = train_model_monthly(model_data)
````
 
The ```output``` struct contains 3 objects:
* ```output.tbl```: data table with rows for each modeled site and columns for input data, erosion rates, and predicted rates
* ```output.mdl1```: statistical model using K1 erodibility (see paper)
* ```output.mdl2```: statistical model using K2 erodibility (see paper)

After fitting a model, you can predict erosion rates at any location:

````matlab
eval_model_monthly(model_data, 44, output.mdl)
````

* The arguments are: input data table, row number, and fitted model
* Note: The fitted model coefficients/exponents are currently hard-coded into the function and passing ```output.mdl``` doesn't actually do anything.
 
Many of the other functions in the repo are outdated or are used by the functions I mentioned here. Be careful deleting functions (sorry).
 
## Literature folder
 
The ```literature``` folder contains the manuscript based on this model (currently under review). The folder also contains a bibliographic database (.bib file), which contains references for all of the literature cited in the paper. You can browse the .bib file in [JabRef](https://www.fosshub.com/JabRef.html) or import it into [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) or [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). The .bib file is a [BiBTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) database generated by Mendeley Desktop and cleaned up in JabRef.

## Other folders

The other folders contain supporting functions. Some are required for the model calculations, others are only for plotting, colorbars, etc.
