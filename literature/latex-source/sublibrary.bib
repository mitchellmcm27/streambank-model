  abstract = {Bank erosion is integral to the functioning of river ecosystems. It is a geomorphic process that promotes riparian vegetation succession and creates dynamic habitats crucial for aquatic and riparian plants and animals. River managers and policymakers, however, generally regard bank erosion as a process to be halted or minimized in order to create landscape and economic stability. Here, we recognize bank erosion as a desirable attribute of rivers. Recent advances in our understanding of bank erosion processes and of associated ecological functions, as well as of the effects and failure of channel bank infrastructure for erosion control, suggest that alternatives to current management approaches are greatly needed. In this article, we develop a conceptual framework for alternatives that address bank erosion issues. The alternatives conserve riparian linkages at appropriate temporal and spatial scales, consider integral relationships between physical bank processes and ecological functions, and avoid secondary and cumulative effects that lead to the progressive channelization of rivers. By linking geomorphologic processes with ecological functions, we address the significance of channel bank erosion in sustainable river and watershed management.},

  abstract = {A recent hypothesis suggests that fluvial processes in areas of the eastern United States are strongly influenced by the demise of colonial mill dams, rather than reflecting a quasi-equilibrium adjustment to the current hydrologic and sediment regime. We evaluated the control of colonial mill dams on twentieth and twenty-first century bank erosion rates on the South River, Virginia, through studies of historical aerial photographs, historical documents, hydrologic and climatic records, and hydraulic modeling. Historical sources and aerial photographs document eight colonial mill dams along the study reach in the early twentieth century; all but one of these dams disappeared in the 1950s, and the last was breached by 1976. From initially low values between 1937 and 1957, mean bank erosion rates increased by more than a factor of 2 after 1957, remaining high through 2005. Accelerated bank erosion rates cannot be explained by changes in storm intensity, the frequency of freeze-thaw cycles, or by changes in the density of riparian trees. Hydraulic modeling suggests that mill dams reduced velocities of the 5 yr flood through {\~{}}80{\%} of our study reach. By considering the timing of mill dam loss, the spatial extent of backwater influence, and the locations of our study sites, we find that the loss of mill dams explains the observed trends in bank erosion rates at 9 (and possibly 10) of our 14 monitoring sites. These results support the hypothesis that the demise of mill dams has been an important influence on fluvial processes in the region.},

  abstract  = {Insight is provided in hydrodynamic processes governing the velocity redistribution in sharp river bends based on simulations of three recent experiments by means of Blanckaert and de Vriend's (2003, 2010) reduced-order nonlinear model without curvature restrictions. This model successfully simulated the flow redistribution and the secondary flow in all three experiments. The results indicate that the flow redistribution is primarily governed by topographic steering, curvature variations and secondary flow, in a broad range of different configurations, including mildly to sharply curved bends, narrow to shallow bends, smooth to rough bends, bends with additional complexities such as horizontal recirculation zones or patches of riverbed vegetation. The relative importance of these three dominant processes is case dependent, and controlled by the parameters C f -1H/B, R/B and streamwise curvature variations. The first parameter characterizes a river reach, whereas the second and third parameters are characteristics of individual bends. Major differences exist between the hydrodynamic processes in mildly and sharply curved bends. First, velocity redistribution induced by curvature variations is negligible in mildly curved bends, but the dominant process in sharp bends. This result is relevant, because most meander models are based on the assumption of weak-curvature variations. Second, nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions play a dominant role in sharp bends, where mild-curvature models overpredict the secondary flow and in some cases even falsely identify it as the dominant process governing the velocity redistribution, which leads to unsatisfactory flow predictions. The reduction in secondary flow strength provoked by the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions is accompanied by a reduction in the transverse bed slope, which reduces the effect of topographic steering. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

  abstract = {Purpose The importance of bank erosion was quantified during three periods (October 2006–April 2007, May 2007–April 2008 and May 2008–April 2009) in the 486 km2 catchment area of River Odense, Denmark. A catchment sediment budget was established including other sediment sources such as tile drains and surface runoff, in-channel and overbank sinks and storage and the resulting bed load and suspended sediment load exported from the catchment. Material and methods Bank erosion and sedimentation were measured using ca. 3,000 erosion pins established in 180 pin plots, each consisting of three vertical lines of pins. Thirty-six representative reaches, each with a length of 100 m, were selected by a stratified random procedure in GIS. Bed load and suspended sediment export from the catchment were measured using a bed load sampler and from continuous measurements of turbidity at the outlet gauging station. Results and discussion The gross sediment input from bank erosion during the three study periods amounted to 21,100–25,200 t in the River Odense catchment, which is considerably higher than the estimated input of sediment from tile drains and surface runoff, which amounted to 220–500 t and 0–100 t, respectively. The measured bed load (20–490 t) was five to 60 times lower than the suspended sediment export from the catchment (1,240–2,620 t) during the three study periods, with the largest difference occurring in the driest year. Sediment sinks and storage were of high importance for the catchment sediment budget as the measured in-channel storage of sediment on stream banks was as high as 16,200–20,100 t, and the overbank sediment sink was estimated at 360–3,100 t. Conclusions Bank erosion was the dominant sediment source (90–94 {\%}) in the River Odense catchment during the three study years. In-channel and overbank sediment sinks and storage dominated the sediment budget as 79–94 {\%} of the sediment input from all sources was not exported from the catchment during the three study years. Such a large attenuation of sediment in river channels and on floodplains is extremely important for fluvial habitats and ecology. Moreover, it has strong implications for attempts to document changes in sediment export following implementation of mitigation measures.},

  abstract  = {The response of river channels to land cover and land use changes in large areas of the tropics and subtropics is poorly documented. Arable agriculture and grazing was introduced to the subtropical catchment of the Brisbane River, Australia, by European settlers in the 1840s. This study examines subsequent changes to the morphology, sediments and vegetation of the Brisbane River in relation to the major drivers of channel change. Documentary evidence from pioneers, paintings, newspapers,maps, surveys, photographs, and instrumental flow records suggests that within 20 years of the introduction of sheep grazing, compaction and degradation of catchment soils and surface drainage produced a shift from perennial to seasonally ephemeral flow and channel incision in minor tributary valleys. The main channel remained stable until the 1850s in the Estuary, and until the 1890s in the middle reaches, where bank erosion increased average channel widths by 18{\%}. Compared to rivers in temperate areas, the Brisbane River has been relatively resilient to changes in land use and land cover. Rates of lateral channel migration have been low since at least 1885, and the level of the channel bed has been stable since 1894. It is shown that the present-day compound channel is a pre-European form with dimensions adjusted to floods with decadal return periods. Increases in sediment supply associated with the incision of tributary streams and later, from widening of the main channel, is consistent with regional evidence for the predominance of channel erosion. This implies an ongoing channel adjustment to changes associated with European land use change.},

The obvious one is the increment of the length of the riparian corridor due to meandering-induced river elongation. However, additional more subtle aspects occur, ascribable to topographic changes induced by meandering dynamics and to their impact on the stochastic structure of the river stage time series. It follows that the increment in vegetation biomass is not simply equal to the increment in the river length. In this work, we investigate this complex picture using suitable bio-geomorphological models through the study of an exemplifying case. This approach can suggest some novel tools for design the restoration of riparian corridors. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Riverbank retreat along a bend of the Cecina River, Tuscany (central Italy) was monitored across a near annual cycle (autumn 2003 to summer 2004) with the aim of better understanding the factors influencing bank changes and processes at a seasonal scale. Seven flow events occurred during the period of investigation, with the largest having an estimated return period of about 1{\textperiodcentered}5 years. Bank simulations were performed by linking hydrodynamic, fluvial erosion, groundwater flow and bank stability models, for the seven flow events, which are representative of the typical range of hydrographs that normally occur during an annual cycle. The simulations allowed identification of (i) the time of onset and cessation of mass failure and fluvial erosion episodes, (ii) the contributions to total bank retreat made by specific fluvial erosion and mass-wasting processes, and (iii) the causes of retreat. The results show that the occurrence of bank erosion processes (fluvial erosion, slide failure, cantilever failure) and their relative dominance differ significantly for each event, depending on seasonal hydrological conditions and initial bank geometry. Due to the specific planimetric configuration of the study bend, which steers the core of high velocity fluid away from the bank at higher flow discharges, fluvial erosion tends to occur during particular phases of the hydrograph. As a result fluvial erosion is ineffective at higher peak discharges, and depends more on the duration of more moderate discharges. Slide failures appear to be closely related to the magnitude of peak river stages, typically occurring in close proximity to the peak phase (preferentially during the falling limb, but in some cases even before the peak), while cantilever failures more typically occur in the late phase of the flow hydrograph, when they may be induced by the cumulative effects of any fluvial erosion.},

  abstract = {Recently, widespread valley-bottom damming for water power was identified as a primary control on valley sedimentation in the mid-Atlantic US during the late seventeenth to early twentieth century. The timing of damming coincided with that of accelerated upland erosion during post-European settlement land-use change. In this paper, we examine the impact of local drops in base level on incision into historic reservoir sediment as thousands of ageing dams breach. Analysis of lidar and field data indicates that historic milldam building led to local base-level rises of 2-5 m (typical milldam height) and reduced valley slopes by half. Subsequent base-level fall with dam breaching led to an approximate doubling in slope, a significant base-level forcing. Case studies in forested, rural as well as agricultural and urban areas demonstrate that a breached dam can lead to stream incision, bank erosion and increased loads of suspended sediment, even with no change in land use. After dam breaching, key predictors of stream bank erosion include number of years since dam breach, proximity to a dam and dam height. One implication of this work is that conceptual models linking channel condition and sediment yield exclusively with modern upland land use are incomplete for valleys impacted by milldams. With no equivalent in the Holocene or late Pleistocene sedimentary record, modern incised stream-channel forms in the mid-Atlantic region represent a transient response to both base-level forcing and major changes in land use beginning centuries ago. Similar channel forms might also exist in other locales where historic milling was prevalent.},

  abstract  = {Identifying the erosion processes contributing to increased basin fine sediment yield is important for reducing downstream impacts on aquatic ecosystems. However, erosion rates are spatially variable, and much eroded sediment is stored within river basins and not delivered downstream. A spatially distributed sediment budget model is described that assesses the primary sources (hillslope soil erosion, gully and riverbank erosion) and sinks (floodplain and reservoir deposition) of fine sediment for each link in a river network. The model performance is evaluated in a 17,000-km2 basin in south-east Australia using measured suspended sediment yields from eight catchments within the basin, each 100-700 km2 in area. Spatial variations within the basin in yield and area-specific yield were reliably predicted. Observed yields and area-specific yields varied by 17-fold and 15-fold respectively between the catchments, while predictions were generally within a factor of 2 of observations. Model efficiency at predicting variations in area-specific yield was good outside forested areas (0.58), and performance was weakly sensitive to parameter values. Yields from forested areas were under-predicted, and reducing the predicted influence of riparian vegetation on bank erosion improved model performance in those areas. The model provided more accurate and higher resolution predictions than catchment area interpolation of measured yields from neighbouring river basins. The model is suitable for guiding the targeting of remediation measures within river basins to reduce downstream sediment yields. Crown Copyright ?? 2008.},

  abstract  = {Spatial heterogeneity in the erosion-resistance properties of the channel banks and floodplains associated with sediment characteristics, vegetation, or bedrock can have a substantial influence on the morphodynamics of meandering rivers, resulting in highly variable rates of bank erosion and complex patterns of planform evolution. Although past studies have examined the spatial variability in bank erodibility within small rivers, this aspect of the erosion-resistance properties for large rivers remains poorly understood. Furthermore, with the exception of recent numerical modeling that incorporates stochastic variability of floodplain erosional resistance, most models of meandering river dynamics have assumed uniform erodibility of the bank and floodplain materials. The present paper investigates the lateral and vertical heterogeneity in bank material properties and riparian vegetation within two elongate meander loops on a large mixed bedrock-alluvial river using several geotechnical field and laboratory methods. Additionally, the bank stability and toe-erosion numerical model (BSTEM) and re-peat terrestrial LiDAR surveys are used to evaluate the capacity of the bank material properties to modify the rates and mechanisms of bank retreat. Results show that the textural properties of the bank materials, soil cohesion, and critical shear stress necessary for sediment entrainment differ substantially between the two bends and are also highly variable within each bend — laterally and vertically. Trees growing along the banks increase the resistance to erosion by contributing to the shear strength of the bank materials and are capable of increasing bank stability along a large river. Locally outcropping bedrock also influences bank erodibility in both bends. The results of this study demonstrate that spatial variability in the erosion-resistance properties of the channel banks is an important factor contributing to spatial variability in the rates and mechanisms of bank erosion de-termined from short-term studies of bank retreat and long-term analysis of changes in channel planform.},

In this study, regional regression equations predicting bankfull width, depth, and cross-sectional area as a function of drainage area are developed for the Physiographic Divisions and Provinces of the U.S. and compared to a nationwide equation. Results show that the regional curves at division level are more reliable than the nationwide curve. Reliability of the curves depends largely on the number of observations per region and how well the sample represents the population. Regional regression equations at province level yield even better results than the division-level models, but because of small sample sizes, the development of meaningful regression models is not possible in some provinces. Results also show that drainage area is a less reliable predictor of bankfull channel dimensions than bankfull discharge. It is likely that the regional curves can be improved using multiple regression models to incorporate additional explanatory variables.},

  volume   = {69},
  pages    = {197--205},
  abstract = {Riparian vegetation exerts a number of mechanical and hydrologic controls on bank stability, which can affect the delivery of sediment to channels. Estimates of root reinforcement of soils have commonly been attained using perpendicular root models that simply sum root tensile strengths and consider these as an add-on factor to soil strength. A major limitation of such perpendicular models is that tensile strength and resistance is wrongly considered to be independent of soil type and moisture, and therefore variations according to these bank properties are omitted in conventional models. In reality, during mass failure of a streambank, some roots break, and some roots are pulled out of the soil intact; the relative proportions of roots that break or pull out are determined by a combination of soil moisture and shear strength. In this paper an equation to predict the frictional resistance of root-soil bonds was tested against field data collected at Long Creek, MS, under two soil moisture conditions. The root pullout equations were then included in the root-reinforcement model, RipRoot, and bank stability model runs for Goodwin Creek, MS, were carried out in order to examine the effects of spatial and temporal variations in soil shear strength and rooting density, on streambank factor of safety. Model results showed that at smaller root diameters breaking forces exceeded pullout forces, but at larger root diameters pullout forces exceed breaking forces. The threshold diameter between root pullout and root breaking varied with soil shear strength, with increasing soil shear strength leading to a greater proportion of roots failing by breaking instead of pullout. Root-reinforcement estimates were shown to reflect changes in soil shear strength, for example, brought about by variations in soil matric suction. Resulting Factor of safety (FS) values for the bank during the period modeled ranged from 1.36 to 1.74 with 1000 grass roots/m2, compared to a range of 0.97 to 1.37 for the non-vegetated bank. Root reinforcement was shown to increase bank stability under the entire range of soil moisture conditions modeled. However, the magnitude of root reinforcement varied in both space and time as determined by soil shear strength and soil moisture.},

  abstract = {Results are presented from the multi-institution partnership to develop a real-time and retrospective North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS). NLDAS consists of (1) four land models executing in parallel in uncoupled mode, (2) common hourly surface forcing, and (3) common streamflow routing: all using a {\{}{\{}1/8{\}}{\^{}}{\{}o{\}}{\}} grid over the continental United States. The initiative is largely sponsored by the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Continental-Scale International Project (GCIP). As the overview for nine NLDAS papers, this paper describes and evaluates the 3-year NLDAS execution of 1 October 1996 to 30 September 1999, a period rich in observations for validation. The validation emphasizes (1) the land states, fluxes, and input forcing of four land models, (2) the application of new GCIP-sponsored products, and (3) a multiscale approach. The validation includes (1) mesoscale observing networks of land surface forcing, fluxes, and states, (2) regional snowpack measurements, (3) daily streamflow measurements, and (4) satellite-based retrievals of snow cover, land surface skin temperature (LST), and surface insolation. The results show substantial intermodel differences in surface evaporation and runoff (especially over nonsparse vegetation), soil moisture storage, snowpack, and LST. Owing to surprisingly large intermodel differences in aerodynamic conductance, intermodel differences in midday summer LST were unlike those expected from the intermodel differences in Bowen ratio. Last, anticipating future assimilation of LST, an NLDAS effort unique to this overview paper assesses geostationary-satellite-derived LST, determines the latter to be of good quality, and applies the latter to validate modeled LST.},

  abstract = {Despite the rapid evolution of computational power, simulation of meander dynamics by means of reduced and computationally less expensive models remains practically relevant for investigation of large-scale and long-term processes, probabilistic predictions, or rapid assessments. Existing meander models are invariantly based on the assumptions of mild curvature and slow curvature variations and fail to explain processes in the high-curvature range. This article proposes a nonlinear model for meander hydrodynamics without curvature restrictions. It provides the distribution of the main flow, the magnitude of the secondary flow, the direction of the bed shear stress, and the curvature-induced additional energy losses. It encompasses existing mild curvature models, remains valid for straight flow, and agrees satisfactorily with experimental data from laboratory experiments under conditions that are more demanding than sharp natural river bends. The proposed model reveals the mechanisms that drive the velocity redistribution in meander bends and their dependence on the river's roughness C(f), the flow depth H, the radius of curvature R, the width B, and bathymetric variations. It identifies C(f)(-1)H/R as the major control parameter for meander hydrodynamics in general and the relative curvature R/B for sharp curvature effects. Both parameters are small in mildly curved bends but O(1) in sharply curved bends, resulting in significant differences in the flow dynamics. Streamwise curvature variations are negligible in mildly curved bends, but they are the major mechanisms for velocity redistribution in sharp bends. Nonlinear feedback between the main and secondary flow also plays a dominant role in sharp bends: it increases energy losses and reduces the secondary flow, the transverse bed slope, and the velocity redistribution.},

  abstract = {Streambank erosion is a primary source of suspended sediments in many waterways of the US Atlantic Piedmont. This problem is exacerbated where banks are comprised of fine sediment produced by the intensive land use practices of early European settlers. A stream in this region, Richland Creek incises into banks comprised of three stratigraphic layers associated with historic land use: pre-European settlement, early European agriculture and development, and water-powered milldam operation. This study aims to identify the bank processes along a reach of Richland Creek that is eroding towards its pre-disturbance elevation. The volume of material that has eroded along this stream since the milldam breached was calculated by differencing a reconstructed surface of the pond bed and an aerial lidar digital terrain model (DTM). Immediately downstream from the study reach, the channel is floored by bedrock and immediately upstream the rate of channel erosion approximately doubled along the longitudinal profile of Richland Creek, which indicate that the study reach spans the transition from a channel dominated by vertical incision in the upstream direction to horizontal widening in the downstream direction. The combined hydrometeorological conditions and dominant processes causing reach-scale cut bank erosion were investigated with analyses of stream stage, precipitation, and streambank volumetric and surfaces change that was measured during nine terrestrial lidar surveys in 2010–2012. The spatial variability of erosion during a simulated precipitation event was examined in a field-based experiment. Erosion was greatest where mill pond sediment columns detached along vertical desiccation and horizontal seepage cracks. This sediment accumulated on the bank toe throughout the study and was a source of readily-entrained fine sediment contrary to the upper reaches where depositional accommodation space is more limited. Findings suggest that hotspots of sediment excavation progress upstream, indicating that restoration efforts should focus upon stabilizing banks at these locations.

To assess and simulate the impacts of alternate land use or climate scenarios on river washload requires modelling techniques that represent sediment sources and transport at the time scales of system response. Building on the mean-annual SedNet model, we propose a new D-SedNet model which constructs daily budgets of fine sediment sources, transport and deposition for each link in a river network. Erosion rates (hillslope, gully and streambank erosion) and fine sediment sinks (floodplains and reservoirs) are disaggregated from mean annual rates based on daily rainfall and runoff. The model is evaluated in the Burdekin basin in tropical Australia, where policy targets have been set for reducing sediment and nutrient loads to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon from grazing and cropping land. D-SedNet predicted annual loads with similar performance to that of a sediment rating curve calibrated to monitored suspended sediment concentrations. Relative to a 22-year reference load time series at the basin outlet derived from a dynamic general additive model based on monitoring data, D-SedNet had a median absolute error of 68{\%} compared with 112{\%} for the rating curve. RMS error was slightly higher for D-SedNet than for the rating curve due to large relative errors on small loads in several drought years. This accuracy is similar to existing agricultural system models used in arable or humid environments. Predicted river loads were sensitive to ground vegetation cover. We conclude that the river network sediment budget model provides some capacity for predicting load time-series independent of monitoring data in ungauged basins, and for evaluating the impact of land management on river sediment load time-series, which is challenging across large regions in data-poor environments. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the recovery of stable bank form and development of vegetated depositional surfaces along the banks of channelized West Tennessee streams. Most perennial streams in West Tennessee were straightened and dredged since the turn of the century. Patterns of fluvial ecological responses to channelization have previously been described by a six-stage model. Dendrogeomorphic (tree-ring) techniques allowed the determination of location, timing, amount, and rate of bank-sediment deposition. Channel cross sections and ecological analyses made at 101 locations along 12 streams, encompassing bends and straight reaches, show that channel and bank processes initially react vertically to channelization through downcutting. A depositional surface forms on banks once bed-degradation and heightened bank mass wasting processes have eased or slowed. The formation of this depositional surface marks the beginning of bank recovery from channelization. Dominating lateral processes, characteristic of stable or natural channels, return during the formation and expansion of the depositional surface, suggesting a relation with thalweg deflection, point-bar development, and meanderloop extension. Characteristic woody riparian vegetation begins to grow as this depositional surface develops and becomes part of the process and form of restabilizing banks. The depositional surface initially forms low on the bank and tends to maintain a slope of about 24??. Mean accretion rates ranges from 5.9 cm/yr on inside bends to 0 cm/yr on most outside bends; straight reaches have a mean-accretion rate of 4.2 cm/yr. The relatively stable, convex upward, depositional surface expands and ultimately attaches to the flood plain. The time required for the recovery process to reach equilibrium averaged about 50 years. Indicative pioneer speccies of woody riparian vegetation include black willow, river birch, silver maple, and boxelder. Stem densities generally decrease with time after and initial flush of about 160 stems per 100 m2.

  abstract = {Phenomena concerning flow, morphology, and water quality in rivers are often investigated by means of a depth-integrated flow model, coupled to a sediment transport model and a water quality model. In such depth integrated models, the vertical structure of the flow is represented by a closure submodel, which mainly has to account for the secondary circulation, which (1) redistributes by advection the flow, the boundary shear stresses, the sediment transport, and dissolved and suspended matter, (2) causes the direction of the bed shear stress to deviate from the direction of the depth-averaged velocity and thereby influences the bed topography, and (3) gives rise to additional friction losses as compared with straight uniform flow. The commonly used linear closure submodels are shown to fail in reproducing essential features in moderately to strongly curved flow, because they neglect the feedback between the downstream velocity and the secondary circulation. A nonlinear closure submodel taking this feedback into account is proposed and shown to yield results that compare well with experimental data, even for very strongly curved flow. The feedback effects turn out to be controlled almost exclusively by a single parameter, which enables their parameterization in a relatively simple way. This control parameter also helps to objectively distinguish weak, moderate, and strongly curved flows. The proposed closure submodel has the potential of improving the performance of depth-integrated flow-sediment-water quality models without much extra computational effort.},

Recently the common practice of fitting power laws using linear regression (LR) on log-transformed data has been criticized, calling into question the conclusions of hundreds of studies. It has been suggested that nonlinear regression (NLR) is preferable, but no rigorous comparison of these two methods has been conducted. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the error distribution determines which method performs better, with NLR better characterizing data with additive, homoscedastic, normal error and LR better characterizing data with multiplicative, heteroscedastic, lognormal error. Analysis of 471 biological power laws shows that both forms of error occur in nature. While previous analyses based on log-transformation appear to be generally valid, future analyses should choose methods based on a combination of biological plausibility and analysis of the error distribution. We provide detailed guidelines and associated computer code for doing so, including a model averaging approach for cases where the error structure is uncertain.},

This study examines the significance of valley wall slumping as a source of both suspended sediment and phosphorus in the Blue Earth River. Several streambanks on the Blue Earth River in south central Minnesota were repeatedly surveyed from 1997 to 2000 to determine annual rates of streambank slumping. Volumetric changes between digital elevation models from successive topographic surveys were converted into changes in mass, and, subsequently, annual erosion rates were calculated based on surface area. An erosion rate constant was derived based on surface area of surveyed sites and applied to an inventory of eroding escarpments along the entire river to estimate the contribution of streambank slumping to the total suspended sediment (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in the Blue Earth River. Erosion rates for surveyed sites ranged from 544 to 3,995 t ha-1 yr-1 (242 to 1,782 tons ac-1 yr-1), with an average rate of 2,154 t ha-1 yr-1 (961 tons ac-1 yr-1). The derived erosion rate constant for slumping sites was 0.23 t m-2 yr-1 (0.024 tons ft-2 yr-1). Between 75,804 and 106,213 t (83,536 to 117,047 U.S. tons) of sediment is delivered to the river annually from all eroding escarpments inventoried, with between 28,047 and 39,299 t (30,908 and 43,307 U.S. tons) transported by flow as TSS. Streambank slumping accounts for 31{\%} to 44{\%} of the TSS load at the mouth of the Blue Earth River. The percentage of the TP load originating from streambank slumping is estimated to be from 7{\%} to 10{\%}, with annual contributions of 12 to 17 t P (14 to 19 U.S. tons).},

  abstract = {An experiment was performed to assess the influence of coarse bank roughness on flow within a sharply curved bend of the Ocklawaha Creek, a sand-bedded stream in northern Florida. This involved obtaining systematic measurements of flow velocity and water-surface topography when the outer bank was rough with natural vegetation, and obtaining an identical set of measurements after removing the vegetation and constructing a smooth wall along the outer bank. Results suggest that the roughness from bank vegetation systematically influences the flow field, particularly the secondary current strength and the position of the high-velocity core, because of its effect on the transverse boundary layer. The roughness essentially produces a backwater effect that inhibits outwardly directed surface flow from closely approaching the outer bank. This suppresses super-elevation on the outside bank and, therefore, weakens the inwardly directed transverse pressure gradient and secondary current. The flow is steered in a downstream direction, and the core of high velocity is nearly centered in the channel. In absence of roughness from vegetation, outwardly directed surface flows approach the outer bank more directly (and earlier in the bend), superelevation on the outside bank is enhanced, and the transverse pressure gradient and secondary current are strengthened. The core of high velocity is displaced toward the outer bank, and its magnitude is increased. Moreover, the streamwise position where the high-velocity core is closest to the outer bank shifts downstream from its position of closest approach in the presence of roughness. This, in principle, should contribute to asymmetrical bend migration, whereas migration in presence of roughness should be nearly in phase with bend curvature such that bends grow in amplitude, albeit slower, and with less asymmetry. ?? 1995.},

  abstract = {River flow is retarded by the frictional resistance of the rough bed and banks of the channel. For any given channel geom-etry, channel slope, and water discharge an increase in frictional resistance causes deeper and slower flow, with con-sequences for flood risk, aquatic habitat, shear stress and bed-material transport. Flow resistance is ultimately due to blocking by, and drag on, topographic irregularities at all scales from individual pebbles to buildings on a floodplain. Modern computer power has enabled three-dimensional (3D) numerical modelling of the physics if sufficient topographic detail is available (Lane, 2005), but for many geomorphologi-cal purposes only the bulk flow properties of a reach are required: cross-sectionally averaged depth, velocity, and shear stress. The effect of friction on these is quantified through simple equations which predict mean velocity (V) from hydraulic radius (R, {\textordfeminine} mean depth in most rivers) and channel slope (S). There are many such equations, and preferences differ somewhat between countries and disciplines, but by far the best-known and most widely-used overall is what in English-speaking countries is known as the Manning equation: V R S n = 2 3 1 2 (1) where n is a roughness coefficient of dimension L -1/3 T. It is always calculated in SI units, so in feet-second units the equa-tion becomes V = 1{\textperiodcentered}49R 2/3 S 1/2 /n. The Manning equation originated as a correction to the Ch{\'{e}}zy equation V = C(RS) 1/2 . Experience showed that C tended to vary with water level in a reach, which was inconvenient for predictive use. In the 1880s Manning and others proposed that C increased as the one-sixth power of depth. This yields Equation 1 with n a constant for the reach. The attraction of a resistance parameter that is invariant with stage is that its value can be calibrated from flow measurements at one time, then used to predict past or future conditions (e.g. palaeoflood discharge or bankfull conveyance). This is the classic applica-tion of the Manning equation. A more recent application is in defining the friction slope in iterative calculations of water surface elevation in one-dimensional (1D) (width-averaged) or two-dimensional (2D) (depth-averaged) numerical flow models and morphodynamic models. The Manning equation is the default, or sometimes only, resistance equation in many such codes. At least one code (HEC-RAS) allows the option of discharge-dependent n, but in many published applications of this and other models a fixed value of n calibrated to water levels at one discharge is used for simulations at all places and times. Still other applications are to situations where flow resistance cannot be calibrated, such as channel design/ restoration and theoretical work on hydraulic geometry. Users must then either assign n (or its equivalent in an alternative resistance law) on the basis of experience or estimate it from a channel property whose design value is known or which is part of the set of variables to be solved. Bed-grain size is the obvious property to use, whilst recognizing that flow resis-tance depends on more than grain roughness. The most wide-spread practice is estimate n by relations proposed in the 1920s by Strickler:},

Uncertainty in Manning's roughness (nM) is the major source of error in natural channels, and sand-bed streams pose difficulties because flow resistance is affected by flow-dependent bed configuration. Our study was designed to develop and validate models for estimating Q from channel geometry easily derived from cross-sectional surveys and available GIS data. A database was compiled consisting of 484 Q measurements from 75 sand-bed streams in Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina (Southeastern Plains), and Florida (Southern Coastal Plain), with six New Zealand streams included to develop statistical models to predict Q from hydraulic variables. Model error characteristics were estimated with leave-one-site-out jackknifing. Independent data of 317 Q measurements from 55 Southeastern Plains streams indicated the model (Q = AcRH0.6906S0.1216; where Ac is the channel area, RH is the hydraulic radius, and S is the bed slope) best predicted Q, based on Akaike's information criterion and root mean square error. Models also were developed from smaller Q range subsets to explore if subsets increased predictive ability, but error fit statistics suggested that these were not reasonable alternatives to the above equation. Thus, we recommend the above equation for predicting in-bank Q of unbraided, sandy streams of the Southeastern Plains.},

A method for developing quantitative prediction of streambank erosion rates and examples of its implementation are presented. The prediction model presented utilizes a rational estimation, process-integration approach. A streambank erodibility index and calculated near-bank stresses are utilized in the prediction model. Streambank characteristics involving measurements of bank heights, angles, materials, presence of layers, rooting depth, rooting density and per cent of bank protection, are used to develop the streambank erodibility index. Measured data are converted to a normalization index for application for a wide range of channel sizes and types. Near-bank stress requires calculation of vertical velocity profiles and shear stress for subsequent distribution of energy calculations in the near-bank region},

  abstract = {Riverbank retreat along a bend of the Cecina River, Tuscany (central Italy) was monitored across a near annual cycle (autumn 2003 to summer 2004) with the aim of better understanding the factors influencing bank changes and processes at a seasonal scale. Seven flow events occurred during the period of investigation, with the largest having an estimated return period of about 1{\textperiodcentered}5 years. Bank simulations were performed by linking hydrodynamic, fluvial erosion, groundwater flow and bank stability models, for the seven flow events, which are representative of the typical range of hydrographs that normally occur during an annual cycle. The simulations allowed identification of (i) the time of onset and cessation of mass failure and fluvial erosion episodes, (ii) the contributions to total bank retreat made by specific fluvial erosion and mass-wasting processes, and (iii) the causes of retreat. The results show that the occurrence of bank erosion processes (fluvial erosion, slide failure, cantilever failure) and their relative dominance differ significantly for each event, depending on seasonal hydrological conditions and initial bank geometry. Due to the specific planimetric configuration of the study bend, which steers the core of high velocity fluid away from the bank at higher flow discharges, fluvial erosion tends to occur during particular phases of the hydrograph. As a result fluvial erosion is ineffective at higher peak discharges, and depends more on the duration of more moderate discharges. Slide failures appear to be closely related to the magnitude of peak river stages, typically occurring in close proximity to the peak phase (preferentially during the falling limb, but in some cases even before the peak), while cantilever failures more typically occur in the late phase of the flow hydrograph, when they may be induced by the cumulative effects of any fluvial erosion.},

The evaluation was made using historical records (airphotos, maps, and streamflow records), field measurements, and soil analyses. The erosion rates were correlated with channel characteristics such as width, depth, curvature, arc angle of channel centerline, channel slope, friction factor, and degree of vegetation on the banks. The correlation was studied using a meander flow model developed by the author. The meander flow model simulated the velocity distribution in the bends and the location of the erosion occurrences. Estimates were made of total sediment influx to the rivers from cutbank erosion.},

  abstract = {Understanding the time scales and pathways for response and recovery of rivers and floodplains to episodic changes in erosion and sedimentation has been a long standing issue in fluvial geomorphology. Floodplains are an important component of watershed systems because they affect downstream storage and delivery of overbank flood waters, and they also serve as sources and temporary sinks for sediments and toxic substances delivered by river systems. Here, 14C and 137Cs isotopic dating methods are used along with ages of culturally related phenomena associated with mining and agriculture to determine rates of sedimentation and morphologic change for a reach of the upper Mississippi River and adjacent tributaries in southwestern Wisconsin and northwestern Illinois. The most important environmental change that influenced fluvial activity in this region during last 10,000 years involved the conversion of a late Holocene mosaic of prairie and forest to a landscape dominated by cropland and pastureland associated with Euro-American settlement. Results presented herein for the Upper Mississippi Valley (UMV) show that the shift from pre-agriculture, natural land cover to landscape dominance by agricultural land use of the last 175-200 years typically increased rates and magnitudes of floodplain sedimentation by at least an order of magnitude. Accelerated overbank flooding led to increased bank heights on tributary streams and, in turn, contributed to more frequent deep flows of high energy. These high energy flows subsequently promoted bank erosion and lateral channel migration, and the formation of a historical meander belt whose alluvial surface constitutes a new historical floodplain inset against the earlier historical floodplain. The new historical floodplain serves as a "flume-like" channel that provides efficient downstream transport of water and sediment associated with moderate and large magnitude floods. Floodplains on lower tributaries, however, continue to experience rates of overbank sedimentation that are of anomalously high magnitude given improved land cover and land conservation since about 1950. This lower valley anomaly is explained by minimal development of historical (agriculture period) meander belts because of relatively low stream power in these channel and floodplain reaches of relatively low gradient. In general, long-term pre-agriculture rates of vertical accretion between about 10,000 and 200 years ago averaged about 0.2 mm yr- 1 in tributary watersheds smaller than about 700 km2 and about 0.9 mm yr- 1 on the floodplain of the upper Mississippi River where the contributing watershed area increases to about 170,000 km2. On the other hand, rates of historical vertical accretion during the period of agricultural dominance of the last 200 years average between 2 and 20 mm yr- 1, with short episodes of even higher rates during times of particularly poor land conservation practices. Significant hydrologic effects of mining and agricultural started by the 1820s and became widespread in the study region by the mid-19th century. The hydrologic and geomorphic influences of mining were relatively minor compared to those related to agriculture. High resolution dating of floodplain vertical accretion deposits shows that large floods have frequently provided major increments of sedimentation on floodplains of tributaries and the main valley upper Mississippi River. The relative importance of large floods as contributors to floodplain vertical accretion is noteworthy because global atmospheric circulation models indicate that the main channel upper Mississippi River should experience increased frequencies of extreme hydrologic events, including large floods, with anticipated continued global warming. Instrumental and stratigraphic records show that, coincident with global warming, a shift to more frequent large floods occurred since 1950 on the upper Mississippi River, and these floods generally contributed high magnitudes of floodplain sedimentation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Riverside vegetation is a significant factor influencing the occurrence and progress of streambed and riverbank erosion. Recent riparian management practice in Australia has focussed on re-establishing or maintaining native riparian vegetation in order to control or prevent erosion as well as regenerate or preserve the complex variety of in-stream and riverside habitats. This work presents an integrated review of field and experimental studies conducted in eastern Australia that evaluate native vegetation's role in mass failure of riverbanks. Several results of these studies have general application and include the following: (1) The presence of riparian forest on riverbanks significantly reduces the likelihood of erosion by mass failure due to reinforcement of riverbank soils by tree roots and this reduced likelihood of mass failure enables a narrower channel cross-section than would otherwise be the case for many Australian coastal streams. (2) A number of Australian tree species have apparently evolved roots that seek the permanent, summer water table in order to survive prolonged dry spells, these root systems are particularly effective in mass failure mitigation due to rooting depths that are commonly greater than 5 m and are sometimes well in excess of 20 m. (3) The so-called "Root-Area-Ratio method" of calculating the shear strength of root-reinforced soil using root tensile strength data and Waldron's [Waldron, L.J., 1977. The shear resistance of root-permeated homogenous and stratified soil. J. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. 41, 843-849] and Wu et al.'s [Wu, T.H., McKinnell, W.P., Swanston, D.N., 1979. Strength of tree roots and landslides on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. Can. Geotech. J. 16, 19-33] simple root model leads to significant overestimation of the actual root-reinforcement due to (a) breakage or pull-out of roots that taper and narrow beneath the shear plane such that individual roots do not achieve the tensile strength calculated on the basis of root diameter at the shear plane; and/or (b) the fact that the soil mass fails progressively along the length of potential shear plane rather instantaneously across the entire shear plane.

  abstract = {Riparian forest vegetation is widely believed to protect riverbanks from erosion, but few studies have quantified the effect of riparian vegetation removal on rates of river channel migration. Measured historical changes in a river channel centreline, combined with mapped changes in floodplain vegetation, provide an opportunity to test how riparian vegetation cover affects the erodibility of riverbanks. We analysed meander migration patterns from 1896 to 1997 for the central reach of the Sacramento River between Red Bluff and Colusa, using channel planform and vegetation cover data compiled from maps and aerial photography. We used a numerical model of meander migration to back-calculate local values for bank erodibility (i.e. the susceptibility of bank materials to erosion via lateral channel migration, normalized for variations in near-bank flow velocities due to channel curvature). A comparison of migration rates for approximately 50 years before and after the construction of Shasta dam suggests that bank migration rates and erodibility increased roughly 50{\%}, despite significant flow regulation, as riparian floodplains were progressively converted to agriculture. A comparison of migration rates and bank erodibilities between 1949 and 1997, for reaches bordered by riparian forest versus agriculture, shows that agricultural floodplains are 80 to 150{\%} more erodible than riparian forest floodplains. An improved understanding of the effect of floodplain vegetation on river channel migration will aid efforts to predict future patterns of meander migration for different river management and restoration scenarios.

  abstract = {Cross-sections were surveyed at straight reaches of 16 sandbed streams in the midwestern U.S. Two stratigraphic horizons are found in the banks at each site, an upper cohesive unit usually composed of silt and clay, and a lower unit composed of sand. Bank erosion on these rivers occurs when the upper cohesive unit is undercut by scour at bends. The overhanging cohesive block fails by toppling forward into the channel. During failure, the soil is primarily in tension rather than compression or shear. Analysis of this failure mechanism leads to a field method for measuring the tensile strength of riverbanks. Measured values of the tensile strength are not correlated with the channel geometry. Thus, the erodibility of the cohesive bank sediments does not influence the geometry of the rivers studied.},

  abstract = {Meandering rivers are intrinsically dynamic geomorphic systems that exhibit progressive change in their planforms as they migrate across their floodplains. Recent research in river meandering has focused on the development of linear mathematical models of meander migration. These models, which are based on momentum and mass conservation principles, aim to capture the basic physical mechanisms governing flow-sediment interactions in meandering rivers. A common attribute of the models is that bank erosion is represented as a linear function of near-bank velocity and near-bank velocity is expressed as a spatial convolution of channel curvature. Thus, in all of these process-based models, planform curvature, as mediated through its influence on near-bank velocity, has a strong effect on channel migration. Mathematical details of the curvature-migration relation depend on the number of curvature related convolution terms in the model; the number of such terms increases with increasing model order. Although first- through fourth-order linear models have been developed, few studies have examined rigorously the relation between planform curvature and migration in natural rivers to determine if even the simplest model-based curvature-migration relations correspond to relations derived from empirical data.This paper evaluates empirically the spatial structure of the relation between upstream planform curvature and local channel migration for bends along the Beatton River, British Columbia, Canada. In particular, we compare empirically derived curvature-migration relations to the exponential-decay form of this relation embodied in first-order linear mathematical models of meander migration. For this purpose, we use a refined empirical methodology and recently developed analytical techniques that overcome limitations of a similar analysis of the Beatton River bends conducted by Furbish (1991). The refined methodology examines the influence of upstream lags of planform curvature on migration rates. The new analytical techniques provide data on channel curvature and migration rate at a much finer spatial interval than in the analysis of Furbish (1991). The validity of the approach for revealing the exponential-decay structure of the curvature-migration relation is confirmed by applying it to a synthetic data set generated using a first-order mathematical model. In contrast to the findings of Furbish (1991), our results for the Beatton River bends show that the structure of the spatially distributed upstream curvature effect is more complex than pure exponential decay. The findings suggest that oscillatory components of the relation between curvature and migration rate are important in the planform dynamics of individual complex bends. These findings are consistent with results of recent empirical analysis of the curvature-migration relation based on discrete signal processing and with the structure of the curvature-migration relation in high-order mathematical models of meander migration. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Using a physically-based model of river meandering and stochastically-generated heterogeneous landscapes, we analyze in detail how spatial variability in erosional resistance influences meander evolution and the emergence of planform complexity. The simulated planforms are remarkably similar to natural freely-meandering rivers, both visually and in their spectral signatures. We quantify the dependence of meander morphology on both the scale of erosional heterogeneity and the magnitude of erosional variability in external forcing. We also show how the sensitivity of autogenic meandering processes to stochastic variability in the environment leads to different patterns of planform evolution even in landscapes with the same mean spatial heterogeneity and magnitude of variability. The results demonstrate that heterogeneity in erosional resistance has a major influence on meander evolution and should be incorporated into morphodynamic models to enhance our understanding of meandering dynamics at the landscape scale.},
